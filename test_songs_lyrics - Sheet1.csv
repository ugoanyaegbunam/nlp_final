Palms,"""Nobody's home
There never was
Applaud her alma mater
It is medicine
It's not your fault
No, it never would
I loved his only daughter
Like he never could
And now you're stuck
Replacing my own tongue
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
I ain't gon' lie, I need to meditate
Take time and just get away
Smoke some tree and go my own pace
But seeing me I picture your face
Shit I can't erase
Keep it simple if you know that
And slowly drinking Shirley Temple
So you don't have no regrets
She aksed me, ""What do I mean to you?""
I said, I'll read your palm
And then I'll sing to you
Then I'll sing to you
And now you're stuck (now you're stuck)
Replacing my own tongue (there's no need to talk)
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (so I read your palms, and I read your palms) (they say)
You lead me on (lead me on, I said, yeah) (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on (I said, I said, lead me on, yes)
There's no need to talk (there's no need to talk) (oh no)
I'll read your palms (so I read your palm) (they say)
You lead me on (lead me on, lead me on) (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
I should've seen that you needed some help, love
You said, ""Enough! I am done with the self love now
I have no doubts
Although my faith's been besieged, see, you can release me""
I should've known that you've grown from pretending
There's nothing fault, nothing false with inventing lies
To hide your guise
Though it's not easy to see through
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on
There's no need to talk (oh no)
I'll read your palms (they say)
You lead me on (I'll lead the way)
Lead me on"""
No One Noticed,"""Maybe I
Lost my mind
No one noticed
No one noticed
It's getting old (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
All alone ('cause I'm so over bein' lonely)
May have lost it (I need virtual connection)
I have lost it (be my video obsession)
No one tried
To read my eyes
No one but you
Wish it weren't true
Maybe I (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
It's not right ('cause I'm so over being lonely)
Make you mine (I need virtual connection)
Take our time (be my video obsession)
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me, then I'll leave without a trace

Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace (maybe I)
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe (it's not right)
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane (make you mine)
Fly to your city excited to see your face (take our time)
Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace"""

Please don't stop the music, music, music

It's getting late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew, that you'd be up in here looking like you do
You're makin' staying over here impossible
Baby, I'm a say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face
I wanna take you away

Rude,"""Saturday mornin', jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old fashioned man
Yeah (yeah)
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know

(Marry that girl) yeah, no matter what you say
(Marry that girl) and we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so rude?
I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me, we will be both
Standin' at that alter
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes, 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessin' 'tll the day I die

Poison Ivy,"""Tell ya
Please don't love her
She's got evil in her eyes
Know my brothers, don't be confused she's in disguise
I've got my mojo, now she can't hurt me no more
But beware of her, she's on the prowl for more
Oh, that girl, that girl, is not the girl you know
Stay away from her, she shines but she don't glow
Oh, that girl will never let you know
'Til the day she's rippin' out your heart you'll see (yeah)

Hellraiser,"""I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
I keep saying that it's getting too much
But I know I'm a liar
Feeling alright in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you
Walking out on another stage
Another town, another place
Sometimes I don't feel right
Nerves wound up too damn tight
People keep telling me it's bad for my health
But kicking back don't make it
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you
I'm living on an endless road
Around the world for rock and roll
Sometimes it feels so tough
But I still ain't had enough
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
But that's what lights my fire
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true

Cruisin' for a Bruisin,"""You better run, run, run, here we come
Revving our engines under the sun
You're cruisin' for a bruisin',
Whoa, keeping me cool!
Smooth and steady!
Slicked back hair man things are getting heavy!
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Two wheels and an open road
Wrapped in leather ready to go!
Don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way!
Bubblegum cherry pop, go to the hop
Hanging with my brother 'cause his friends are so hot
While they're cruisin', for some bruisin'!
Alright, I went to the drive-in and what did I see?
A hundred little betties all staring at me!
I was cruising, for some lovin'!
I got these two wheels and an open road
Just pop that clutch, I'm ready to go!
Don't stop, stop the music!
We ride fast like a bullet
We do anything we want, anytime we want
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
We just ride, ride, ride all day!
We're not gonna live any other way
Oh no, we're not gonna live any other way, oh!
Goes 1, 2, 1, 2, 3!
A who, who, who's ridin' with me?
I gotta a gang full of brusiers, all crusin' with me!
And we're tearin' up, we're tearin' up, we're tearin up the streets
Don't stop, stop the music!

In the End,"""It starts with one, one thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day, the clock ticks life away
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryna hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then, but it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"""
Unwritten,"""I am unwritten
Can't read my mind

The pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Oh, oh, oh

Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way

She got thick but she wanna get thin again
Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' SKIM 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright
I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious
I went from the Toyota Yaris to Urus
They had their chance but blew it
Now this gyal want me in her uterus
Fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (fuck it)
Take a look at these diamonds wrong
It's a life of squintin', can't just stare
With bae through thick and thin
She already thick, so I'm halfway there
Brown and bad
Couldn't change my mind, I was halfway there
One hundred meters, huh
I just put nine gyal in a Sprinter (uh)
One hundred eaters
They won't fit in one SUV (nah)
S-O-S, somebody rescue me
I got too many gyal, too many-many gyal, I got
They can last me the next two weeks (uh, huh)
Alright, like send the address through, please
SUV, the outside white
The inside brown like Michael Jack'
More time, man build a line and trap
Spend like I don't even like my stack
Pistol came on a Irish ferry
Let go and it sound like a tap dance
The way that I ball
No yellow, the ref have to give me a black card
Who did what we're doin' with rap?
Man couldn't sell out his show after all them years of doin' the cap
Sprinter, two gyal in a van
Inter, two man in Milan
Heard one of my tings datin' P. Diddy
Need twenty percent of whatever she bags
Outside, my head in my hands
I told her my name is Cench
She said, ""No, the one on your birth certificate""
Your boyfriend ran from that diamond test
'Cause they weren't legitimate (nah)
She Turkish-Cypriot but her curves Brazilian
I want her and bro wants her affiliate
I'm cheap, still hit a chick like, ""Yo, can I borrow your Netflix?""
She a feminist, she think I'm sexist
Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta password
I'll give you the pin to my AmEx
Huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum
Dinner table, I got manners, huh
T-shirt tucked in, napkin
""Still loadin'"" that's the caption
I've only amounted a minimal fraction
Eat good, I got indigestion
Bare snow in my hood, no Aspen
Can't get rid of my pain with Aspirin
Dave just came in a Aston, I'm makin' that Maybach Music (Maybach Music)
They're tryna insult my intelligence, sometimes I may act stupid
I never went Uni, I been on a campus selling cocaine to students

Crooked Smile,"""I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing but it's funny how
My shit is crooked look at how far I done got without it
I keep my twisted grill, just to show them kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Oh, you a woman? I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you
Killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror but its clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paint brush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back
And it got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking
Not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl you're a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? if it's not, girl you don't care
Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch
That them broads can't be, and that's you
Never let 'em see you frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)
(You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
Like the sun, I know you know I found my way back round)
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know them movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation, that's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation, or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, cause we in hell already
I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
Yo one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga let's make a mil
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother out of jail
I got money for the bail now, well now
If you asking will I tell now? Hell naw
I ain't snitching cause
Man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You're the one that was trying to keep me way down
But like the sun know you know I found my way back round
Crooked smile, we could style on 'em (back 'round)

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us

Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
La-la-la-la-la
If you've got someone you like
(Don't you love when I come around)
Somebody just tell somebody
If you've got someone you like
Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody (build you up then I take)
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

Ode To The Mets,"""Up on his horse, up on his horse
Not gonna wake up here anymore

Easy to say, easy to do
But it's not easy, well, maybe for you
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good
Hope that you read it, think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up, plans his attack

Drums please, Fab
And I got it all, I got it all
Waiting for me down on the street
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine
Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there, I needed you there
But I didn't know, I didn't know
Go alone
I'll go alone
We'll go alone
I'll go alone
Back from his trip, he's at the door
When he gets back, he's on the phone
Innocent eye, innocent heart
No, it's not wrong, but it's not right
Innocent time out on his own
Not got gonna do that, I'm out of control
I was just bored playin' the guitar
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard
It's the last one now, I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back
Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubix cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom
Of the ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left
Is us, so pardon the silence
That you're hearing is turning
Into a deafening, painful, shameful roar"""
Workin Out,"""Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm bout to jump in the fuel
I'm really not afraid of nothin'
Look on everything, I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama call, ""Where the fuck you at?""
""On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back""
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too, shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry cause I'm numb inside
If you wonder why, ask, ""What's the matter?""
'Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out
Shit ain't really working out
Quiet
Don't explain
What is there to gain
Shit, shit ain't really working out
Now I got a little bread, got my niggas working outta town
Baby your ass fat, shit, I can see you working out, shit
And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out?
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women, Wonder Woman
Working for it if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
Difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
Got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil
Or off the pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out

E. Coli,"""My thoughts, dreams, plots, and my schemes

My cart full of sin, when I shop it's a spree
I got some new leaves
I'm like ""What's the word with you, sir?""
You just moss on a tree, I'm not concerned with you
I leave the curb when I'm crossing the street
I'm watching out for the Mark of the Beast
The badge on the policeman, black carpenter pants
A half ounce in 'em, another half ounce in my fleece
And on account of this, go 'head and count me out of this
I'm out with the breeze
I'm dodging county, it's a thousand degrees
It's back alley shit, my nigga, look
My eyes wide open, I'm sleepy, I'm on a highway
Paul Giamatti, a nigga was sittin' sideways
A bubble and a Skully when traveling through the Tri-state
And trouble play the gun, hear it clap and it make my mind race
Back and forth, I place fourth, keep your torch
Got your morsels on my plate, motherfucker
I wasn't born, mama snatched me off the motherfucking stork on a Friday
Say that shit to my face"""

Mobbin', schemin', lootin', hide your bodies
Long as you dreamin' 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do
In the droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)

Survive (Ban Rap),"""(I know that we'll both survive)
Ugh, back then I was just a bandit
Stealing and pillaging what I demanded
Getting my hand in a plethora of trouble
I struggle that struggle I took it for granted
It was a gambit knew what to do
Wanted to steal from the fountain of youth
I could be living forever
You bet its a treasure. I'd get it if it wasn't for you
Blasted me back off the tree tops
Lasting not gonna make me stop
Grasping you know that I'll keep up
Asking like ""look at what she's got""
Reasons weren't malicious and if it's really nutritious
Then I guess it's my position to listen stop my ambition
We ended up talking sharing our stories
And laughing through night and day
You hate to stay
I offered the prospect that maybe I'd leave and take you away
But ""no"" you say some people have a place
And have to play their part
I may have come to steal the cup but it was you that stole my heart
With every breath
Through life and through death
I'm holding you by my side
So open your eyes
Not your time to die
I know that we'll both survive 
Uh
But suddenly fire is brewing
And spewing attacks from a demon I can defeat him
I'm attacking him back and his
Rampage won't crack and his body's not weakened
Drink from the fountain cause you know you gotta save yourself
You idiot I'm not the one that needed help
Filled with the rage, I'll engage as I hit you again and again
Bludgeon your brains, call me insane
Now that I'm broken see what I became
Out of my way, you are my prey
Crushing your body, make sure you will pay
Blood it will spray, life I will slay
Make sure you never forget the day it changed
Now I'm immortal but my soul is hollow mind is blank
Fighting every moment to find a way that can bring you back
My heart's intact, that's a fact, I will always feel it
No matter what it takes your love, y'know I'll always steal it
With every breath
Through life and through death
I'm holding you by my side
So open your eyes
Not your time to die
I know that we'll both survive"

Last Time I Saw You,"""Beggin' me to stay and then you walk away
There's something that you wanted to say
I was in a rush, but you said you were crushed
And I said, ""I'd be back, it's okay""
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish I didn't waste precious time the night when I called you
I wish I remembered to say I'd do anything for you
Maybe I pushed you away because I thought that I'd bore you
Listen, so close, but we were so distant
Wish I'da known in that instant
Ignored the hints or I missed it
I killed it
You'd always be in attendance
No flights, but always attendant
Handwritten letter, you penned it
Them nights we wish never ended
Those rules that we wish we bended
Heartbreak that we never mended
Those messages we unsended
Best friends, we somehow unfriended
Ain't care 'bout who we offended
Parties they wish we attended
Got drunk and laughed, it was splendid
I wish I'da hugged you tighter the last time that I saw you
I wish I didn't waste precious time the night when I called you

I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest

It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
Mh, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love

Mh, for a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love (had a love, ayy)
had a love (had a love, ayy)
Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But, but I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me

Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right

Mary On A Cross,"""We were speeding together
Down the dark avenues
But besides of the stardom
All we got was blues
But through all of that sorrow
We were riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go
We were scanning the cities
Rocking to pay the dues
But besides of the glamour
All we got was bruised
But through all of that sorrow
We were riding high
And the truth of the matter is
I never let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another Bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that
We were searching for reasons
To play by the rules
But we quickly found
It was just for fools
Now through all of this sorrow
We'll be riding high

I never let you go, let you go
You go down just like Holy Mary

Them Changes,"""Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?

A heartless, broken mess"""
The Color Violet,"""I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, markin' X on the dot
She calls my phone up but I told her, ""I'm a loner"" (uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (uh)
We hit the highway, 1-5-5, with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
I lost my heart
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay but, playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (that's why), ooh, yeah (uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh
Uh, face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, blankets of love all on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh

Rockstar,"""I'm through with standing in line to clubs we'll never get in

On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at 37 thousand feet

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs, so I can eat my meals for free

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip-sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Across the field where the creek turns back
By the old stump row

That nobody knows baby get ready

Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with you
Spring is almost over and the summer's come
And the days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along, baby get ready
And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night, baby get ready

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Feel like the least of all your problems, you can reach me if you wanna
Stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out, like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you to
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for

Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
I can't fix each and all your problems, I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returning my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watching movies, talking to the walls in my room
Walking through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday you can take it from me
I'm up too late thinking 'bout you
In MIA for
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms (what you want, ay)
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want

End of Beginning,"""Just one more tear to cry
One teardrop from my eye

Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning
This song has started now
And you're just finding out
Now isn't that a laugh?
A major sacrifice
But clueless at the time
Enter, Caroline
""Just trust me, you'll be fine""

Hotel California,"""On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This could be heaven or this could be hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes-Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still, those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
""Relax, "" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"""""
Southern Nights,"""Southern nights

That he has found a better way

Its precious beauty lies
Just beyond the eye it goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old
Old man
He and his dog, that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy
Feel so good
Feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting

Play That Funky Music,"""Hey, do it now

Hey, once I was a boogie singer

I never had no problems
Burnin' down the one-night stands

And everything around me
Got to start to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly
Yes, I did
To disco down and check out the show

Yeah they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die.""

'Til you die?

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish
To not see I was the one behind

So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step by the way
... we can do
I said, I must go back there
I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy

Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die.""

'Til you die?
Oh, 'til you die

Gonna play some electrified funky music

Hey, wait a minute

Now first it wasn't easy
Changing rock-and-rolling minds
And things were gettin' shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind

Oh, but now it's so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (you know, I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day

When they were dancin' and singin'
And movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down that boogie
And play that funky music 'til you die.""

'Til you die?
Oh, 'til you die

Higher,"""When dreaming I'm guided to another world

Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
And make them mine
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets"""
Lost,"""Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost
Faith is the substance
Manos arriba!

Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World,"""Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh, why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"""
